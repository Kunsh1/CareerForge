### 1. Foundational Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to assess core competencies:

* **Adaptability**: Handling change (“Describe a major change you went through and how you adapted.”)
* **Assertiveness**: Standing your ground (“When did you take a firm stand with a colleague?”)
* **Attention to Detail**: Accuracy (“Describe a task where precision was critical.”)
* **Communication**: Explaining complex ideas effectively (“Explain a complex idea to someone with limited knowledge.”)
* **Creativity**: Innovation (“When did you invent a new approach to solve a problem?”)
* **Customer Service**: Managing difficult clients (“Tell me about a challenging customer situation you handled.”)
* **Decisiveness**: Quick decisions (“Describe a time you made a fast decision with major impact.”)
* **Developing Others**: Coaching and mentoring (“When did you coach someone to improve performance?”)
* **Other competencies**: Reliability, initiative, teamwork, stress management, professionalism.

### 6. Structured Interviewing Frameworks & Templates

Standardize interviews for fairness and clarity:

* **Protocol Elements**:

  * Define domain and core questions.
  * Use consistent leadoff questions and follow‑ups.
  * Score using standardized rubrics.

* **Answer Frameworks**:

  * **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
  * **CARL** (Context, Action, Result, Learning)
  * **SOAR** (Situation, Obstacle, Action, Result)

* **Templates**:

  ```
  Introduction → candidate info → questions (behavioral & technical) → interviewer notes → scoring
  ```

* **Best Practices**:

  * Base questions on job analysis.
  * Train interviewers for consistent delivery.
  * Ask identical core questions across candidates to reduce bias.
