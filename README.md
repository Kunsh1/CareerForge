## 🎯 Problem Statement

The challenge is to create an Interview Trainer Agent, powered by RAG, that prepares users for job interviews by generating tailored question sets and preparation strategies based on their profile, experience level, and job role. This AI-driven assistant builds user confidence, sharpens responses, and increases success rates in competitive hiring environments by retrieving information from verified sources like professional networks, company databases, and HR guidelines.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The agent uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides their job role, industry, and experience level (e.g., "Help me prepare for a Junior Data Analyst interview").
2.  **Retrieval**: The agent uses this input to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information from connected data sources, such as interview question databases, professional networking guides, and HR best practices.
3.  **Augmentation**: The retrieved information (the "context") is then passed to the IBM Granite LLM along with the original user prompt.
4.  **Generation**: The LLM uses the provided context to generate a high-quality, relevant, and supportive response, ensuring the answers are grounded in real-world data and not hallucinated.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To deploy this agent yourself, you will need an IBM Cloud account.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory and open the `ibm_watsonx_deployment_notebook.ipynb` file.
3.  **Follow the Steps**: The notebook contains all the necessary code and instructions to configure and deploy the AI agent using the IBM Watsonx SDK.
4.  **Run and Deploy**: Execute the cells in the notebook to deploy your own instance of the Interview Trainer Agent.
